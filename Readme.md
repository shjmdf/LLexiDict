# LLexiDict📖
**An LLM-powered multilingual dictionary that understands context and nuance.**

Designed and written by shjmdf.

LLexiDict is an open-source project designed to bridge the gap between the rigidity of traditional dictionaries and the nuanced, contextual understanding required for deep language learning. Powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), LLexiDict provides richer definitions, context-aware examples, and detailed lexical analysis for **English, Japanese, French, and Latin**.

## 💬 Why create LLexiDict?
Traditional dictionaries are invaluable, but they often have limitations. They can be rigid, lacking the contextual awareness needed to understand complex language—a pain point especially clear in language exams like the GRE or TOEFL. They can be good instructors but never promise to cultivate a native speaker.

When I was a senior high school student, I found myself frustrated by the Cloze Tests in my English exams (These words might sting a little for my English teacher, but I have nothing but the utmost respect for her. She's the one who taught me to appreciate the true depth and nuance of the language.). Traditional dictionaries failed to capture the subtle nuances, or it took ages to find a seemingly relevant definition within a vast entry.

Now, as a college student majoring in Computational Linguistics and Computer Science, I hoped those nightmares would be over. But when preparing for the GRE, the Text Completions and Sentence Equivalence questions proved even more excruciating. When I learned about ***Island Constraints***—a linguistic concept that ran contrary to my second-language instincts—I realized that mastering context and subtle nuance is unavoidable. It is the very soul of language learning.

Fortunately, we have LLMs.

LLexiDict was born to tackle this exact problem. It aims to be an intelligent dictionary that combines the power of AI with the precision of human review(This feature is a long-term goal that will heavily rely on community contributions to ensure its quality and scale.), ensuring the accuracy and reliability that language learners need to truly master a word's meaning.
## 🚀 Features
Context-Aware Definitions: Provides meanings that adapt to the context you're querying, not just a flat list of all possible definitions.

Nuanced Distinction: Focuses on lexical choice, offering precise comparisons for synonyms, perfect for tackling advanced vocabulary challenges (GRE, TOEFL, etc.).

Rich Example Sentences: Generates diverse, clear examples that demonstrate a word's practical application in various scenarios.

### Inspiration
This project was significantly inspired by the excellent work on the [TICKurt/english-dictionary-web](https://github.com/TICKurt/english-dictionary-web) project
Their approach to **building a scientific English learning platform based on LLM-defined data** served as one of a key motivation for the development of LLexiDict.
